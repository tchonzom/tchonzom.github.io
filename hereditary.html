          <h2> <strong> Top Three Favorite Things <strong> </h2>

          <ul>

            <li> The horrifying haunting of the youngest daughter, who dies because her brother was
              speeding on his way to bring her to the hospital and killed her in a car crash. His car hit
              the telephone poll, decapitating his little sister.
            </li>

            <li> The grandmother was extremely dark and was the matriarch and leader of her cult, which was trying
              to summon a strong demon king which was pretty cool.
            </li>

            <li> In the ending, the people who died in the movie were all inside of the treehouse bowing down to a
              horrifying shrine of the demon and the brother/son of the family successfully became the male host
              of the demon which was the goal of his grandmother's cult all along
            </li>

          </ul>
